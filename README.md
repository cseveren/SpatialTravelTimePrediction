Draft paper lives in Overleaf

### Methods

Implement the following methods:

1. Linear Regression
2. Adaptive Kernel Imputation
3. Random Forests
4. Gradient Boosting (via XGBoost)
5. Convolutional Neural Networks

To predict
- Auto Travel Times
- Multi-Modal Travel Times (including Auto)

Both
- Ignoring congestion
- Accounting for congestion layer

As well as using
- Only survey data
- Survey data and simulated uncongested travel times from R5R engine
